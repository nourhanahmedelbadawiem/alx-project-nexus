# ALX Project Nexus

## Overview

The **ProDev Engineering Program** is a comprehensive learning journey that covers both **Frontend and Backend Engineering**.  
The backend track focuses on building scalable server-side applications and APIs, while the frontend track emphasizes creating modern, responsive, and accessible user interfaces that consume these backend services.

This repository serves as a documentation hub for my major learnings as a **ProDev Frontend Engineering learner**, highlighting the tools, technologies, concepts, challenges, and best practices acquired throughout the program.

### Program Goals
- Build strong foundations in frontend engineering.
- Develop responsive, accessible, and maintainable applications.
- Understand how frontend systems integrate with backend services.
- Prepare learners for real-world, production-level projects.

### Learning Outcomes
- Ability to build modern web and mobile applications.
- Strong understanding of frontend architecture and workflows.
- Improved collaboration skills within cross-functional teams.
